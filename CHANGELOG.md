# Changelog

All notable changes to Codex RPC are documented here.

## [0.3.16] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Two new Settings toggles under **Display** — `Effort` and `Credits` — to hide the reasoning effort label and the credits-remaining counter from status bar and Discord state independently.

## [0.3.15] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Tray menu trimmed to **Settings · 5h · Week · Spark 5h · Spark week · Start on Windows · Quit**. Mode selectors and per-toggle visibility items are now configured exclusively from the Settings window.
- The four rate-limit entries are read-only (greyed out) and refresh every ~2s with the live "remaining" percentage parsed from the daemon status file. Mode and Discord usage filters remain unchanged in Settings.

## [0.3.14] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark rate limits (5h + Weekly) parsed from `rateLimitsByLimitId` and surfaced in tray status, Discord state, and large-image tooltip.
- Two new Settings toggles — "Spark 5h" and "Spark wk" — with matching tray menu entries.

### Fixed

- Account usage now appears immediately after Codex launches (no first-request needed). The probe spawns `codex app-server` directly with a JSON-RPC `initialize` + `account/rateLimits/read` handshake instead of `app-server proxy`, which required an existing control socket that the desktop app doesn't expose.
- Spark toggles now persist correctly: `RpcSettings` was duplicated between `daemon.rs` and `main.rs`; only the daemon copy carried the new fields, so saves dropped them silently and the daemon always reverted to defaults.

### Changed

- Settings panel label `RPC mode` → `IPC Mode` to match the underlying Discord IPC mechanism.
- Account-usage probe now caches results for 30 seconds (Rust) / refreshes asynchronously in the background (Node) to avoid spawning a fresh `codex app-server` on every detection tick.

## [0.3.13] - 2026-05-08

### Security

- Codex CLI invocations (Rust daemon + Node detector) now use only absolute trusted paths — bare `codex`/`codex.cmd` candidates removed, preventing PATH/search-order hijacking.
- `reg.exe` invocation on Windows now uses `%SystemRoot%\System32\reg.exe` instead of an unqualified name, preventing binary-planting attacks on the startup-toggle feature.
- macOS release workflow hardened: `contents: write` scoped to upload step only; tag input validated against `vX.Y.Z` format; checkout forced to `refs/tags/` with `persist-credentials: false`.

## [0.3.12] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- Local Codex usage refresh (login status) now respects its 60-second cooldown correctly in both the Rust daemon and Node detector.

## [0.3.11] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Account usage sync via Codex CLI `app-server proxy` JSON-RPC — live rate-limit data is now preferred over local rollout file parsing.

### Fixed

- macOS release workflow added for automated DMG/binary publishing.

## [0.3.10] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- Usage reset fallback now trusts post-reset snapshots instead of forcing 5h usage to 100%.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- Model and reasoning effort now sync from the latest Codex turn context instead of stale top-level config.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- Usage limits now show 100% after their reset time even before Codex writes a fresh rate-limit snapshot.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- Tauri desktop daemon now uses the same multi-rollout usage selection as the CLI daemon.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- Discord RPC now refreshes when usage percentages change.
- Usage display now prefers global Codex limits over model-specific Spark limits.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- Usage limits now fall back across recent Codex rollout logs when the newest CLI/Desktop session has no rate-limit snapshot.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- macOS Tauri build with `.app`, `.dmg`, and portable arm64 binary artifacts.
- macOS Codex process detection for CLI and desktop activity.

- macOS start-at-login support through a LaunchAgent.

### Changed
